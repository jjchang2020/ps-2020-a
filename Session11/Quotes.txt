A little learning is a dangerous thing
A picture is worth a thousand words
A thing of beauty is a joy forever
A mind always employed is always happy
Don't hate, it's too big a burden to bear
Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder
For fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names
God helps them that help themselves
He that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing
He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword
Hitch your wagon to a star
I want to know God’s thoughts… the rest are details
I’d rather live with a good question than a bad answer
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
If you would be loved, love and be lovable
In Heaven, all the interesting people are missing
It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love your neighbor - but don't pull down your hedge
Nature abhors a vacuum
Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake
Never leave that till to-morrow which you can do to-day
Power Corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Religion is the opiate of the people
Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far
That which doesn't kill us makes us stronger
The Almighty has his own purposes
The best way to see Faith is to shut the eye of Reason
The buck stops here
The child is father of the man
The language of friendship is not words, but meanings
The pen is mightier than the sword
The time to repair a roof is when the sun is shining
There are no gains without pains
There never was a good war or a bad peace
Time is money
To err is human, to forgive divine
Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing
